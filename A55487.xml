            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OF all the miſtakes and miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings of men, in the grand Myſteries of our Religion, there is none that may more deſervedly be put into the catalogue of popular, and (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt) univerſall errors, then the erroneous conceivings and miſapprehenſions of the doctrine of the Sabbath; wherein, not onely the Antient and Modern Jews, but alſo many Chriſtians, both learned and lewd, did, and do alike erre: Inſomuch that now
<pb facs="tcp:34379:4"/>
of late, the old ſaying is come to paſſe, <hi>Communis error facit jus;</hi> for we have lived to ſee Sabbatarian errors to be grown up into a Law, and to be confirmed. And the very appllation of Sabbath (which in the Moral part of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſignifies Chriſt our Redeemer; and in the latter or Ceremonial part of the ſaid Commandment, ſignifies the ſeventh day from the Creation, or laſt day of the week) to be applied to our <hi>Sunday,</hi> which is the firſt day of the week, and the eighth from the Creation. And this, even by many Preachers, ſome of them being very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; whereby the leſſe learned ſort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are miſled into the ſame error with the Jews, who would ſee no further into the great myſtery of the Sabbath, than onely the conſecrating of the ſeventh day, as ours at this time do the eighth day: And neither of them will be as yet perſwaded, to look more deeply into that moſt divine and gracious Law of the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>The principall miſleader into theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in our daies, is, I conceive, that otherwiſe pious and learned Book, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Practiſe of Piety;</hi> the right Author whereof, I think, is concealed: A late <note n="a" place="margin">Advice to a Son.</note> Writer thinketh, that it hath been too oft printed, becauſe (as he ſaith) it is

Whereby it is evident enough, that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning of the firſt day of the week for holy aſſemblies, was not originally, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Chriſt's Reſurrection on that day.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, the ſucceeding Church did conform unto that day, becauſe their Predeceſſors had fixed thereon. And they further alledged new reaſons for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it; They conſidered, That Chriſt did indeed riſe that day from the dead, That the deſcending of the holy Ghoſt at <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> That the creation of Heaven, and Earth, and Light; That <hi>Manna</hi> rained from Heaven firſt; and all theſe, on this firſt day of the week. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> addeth, (if you will believe him) <note n="b" place="margin">Bel. de Cultu Sanct. l. 3. c. 11.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34379:7"/>
But, in ſucceeding times, the Jewiſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of dayes, by Firſt, Second, Third, &amp;c. of the Sabbath, or Week, was diſuſed, Therefore the Church affixed a new name to that day, according to the Cuſtom of their Country, or Ordinance of the Church; and hence came the denomination of <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and <hi>Sunday,</hi> reſpectively.</p>
            <p>We cannot with reaſon, account this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, <hi>Sunday,</hi> to be any diſparagement to the ſolemnity of the feſtivall, in regard, that our Saviour himſelfe, (for whoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we ſanctifie this Day) is called by his Prophets, <hi>The Sun which ſhall no more</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:34379:13"/>
to prove, becauſe Chriſt never at all mentioned it, nor did any Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, (as is ſhewed before) nor did any of the Sabbatizing Jews then apprehend it, or to this day believe it.</p>
            <p>For theſe, or for better reaſons, the late Learned and Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> (my moſt dear Country) when he was Profeſſor of Theology in <hi>Oxford,</hi> doubted not to conclude publickly upon this very place: <hi>That it is ridiculous for any to argue for a confirmation of a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Dr. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux, de Sab. Orat. <hi>An.</hi> 1622.</note>

            </p>
            <p>I find alſo another pretty argument uſed of late, to prove our <hi>Sunday</hi> to be a Sabbath; for, <hi>The word Sabbath ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth Reſt; therefore Sunday being a day of Reſt, ought to be called Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi> If this will hold, VVhy ſhould not our late frequent <hi>Faſting-dayes,</hi> and <hi>Thanks-givings,</hi> be called Sabbaths, which were enforced by watch-men, and under penalties, with as great caution as our <hi>Sundayes,</hi> from working and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Or why ſhould not <hi>Nights,</hi> the time of generall Reſt; and our <hi>Beds,</hi> the place thereof; and even our <hi>Graves,</hi> be called Sabbaths? But if the Inventer of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb facs="tcp:34379:13"/>
had conſidered, that the Fourth Commandment, or Scripturall Sabbath, doth not ſignifie onely the corporall Reſt of man, but onely his ſpirituall Reſt; and moreover, and moſt principally, the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Reſt of God, (as it is ſaid, <hi>God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

            <p>There is yet another ſcruple, occaſioned by our tranſlation of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which either ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Notwithſtanding all this; it may be granted, that Chriſt giving that monition to <hi>pray,</hi> did fore-ſee and relate to ſome
<pb facs="tcp:34379:14"/>
kind of Law, whereby the Jews of that time would be girt and obliged, to keep the old Sabbath. But if we enquire by what Law, we ſhall find it to be neither the Moral, nor the Ceremonial Law of God, but onely a popular <hi>Club-Law,</hi> or Law of Arms; which was indeed the tyrannicall and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Law, of thoſe grand <hi>Zelots</hi> and Rebells, which cruelly inſulted over their Country-men the Jews, as <hi>Simon, John,</hi> and <hi>Eleazer,</hi> (of whom we read much in <note n="a" place="margin">Joſ. de Bello. lib. 8.</note>

            <p>If we now examine the Jewiſh ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and compare them with the practiſes or commands of ſome ſabbatizing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, we ſhall find them running parallel, <note place="margin">Buxdo f.</note> as they are recorded, bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h by our own, and by forrain Writers; as 1. If a Jew fell <note place="margin">Hiſtory of the Sab.</note> ſhort of home on a Sabbath-Eve, he muſt ſtay there, in wood, wilderneſſe, or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, till the Sabbath were paſt. 2.

Clogs or Pattens; nor a Taylor his Needle; nor milk Kine, nor lift a beaſt out of a ditch, nor kill a flea on that day.</p>
            <p>So ſome Chriſtian Sabbatarians have <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr. Tho. Roger's</hi> Preface on the 39 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</note> taught publickly: 1. To work on <hi>Sunday,</hi> (Lord's day, they call it) or throw a boule, is a ſin as great, as to kill a man, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery. 2. To kill a cock, as bad as to kill a ſervant. 3. To make a Feaſt, or dreſſe a Wedding-dinner, as bad as for a father to cut his own child's throat. 4. To ring more Bells then one, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit murder. They ſay, one may not carry provender to an Horſe; a Maid-ſervant would not ſweep her Kitchin, nor waſh her Diſhes; a zealous ſonne would not ride for a Bone-ſetter, when his Father's bones were broken. Some ſchool-men among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt's, have bin as eager in this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition as ours; They taught, that it is as great a ſinne to ſtitch a poor Man's broken ſhoe on Sunday, as to kill a Thouſand men, <note n="a" place="margin">Adverſ.

when in thoſe other lawes no puniſhment was mentioned for tranſgreſſours; As in the ten commandments we find no viſible nor tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral penalty mentioned for the ſins of Idolatry, Sabbath-breaking, Diſhonorers of Parents, adulterers, or falſewitneſſes; the puniſhment being either reſerved to God, or referred to the laws Judiciall or Politick.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome, that have thought fit that theſe judicial laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould (with ſome additions) be made the laws Politick of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

                  <p n="2">2. Many of them were enacted purpoſely to ſerve for the diſcovery of the Meſſiah, &amp; to be an evidence of the fulfilling of ſome Prophecies w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> concerned the Tribe &amp; genealogy of Chriſt before his actuall manifeſtation in the fleſh.</p>

Indeed, God did extraordinarily provide in ſuch years for that people, being under that command; but we have not any ſuch command, nor war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant now to expect ſuch miraculous proviſions.</p>

                  <p>Juſtly therefore are the Jewes reproved for doting ſo much on the Shadow-ſabbath, and utterly neglecting the Subſtance, and body, which was but only repreſented by that ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, <hi>like the dog in the</hi>

                  <p>For this cauſe, it may reaſonably be thought, that our Lord Jeſus neither at the diſſolution of the Old Jewiſh Sabbath day, nor at any time after, did command, or ſo much as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate any <hi>new Sabbath day</hi> for Chriſtians, leſt Chriſtians alſo, like the Jewes, ſhould errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly think, that the <hi>Moral precept,</hi> for Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the Sabbath, confiſted only in the ſtrict obſervation of a day, and thereby utterly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the moſt holy, moſt neceſſary and <hi>Grand Sabbath,</hi> which is Chriſt: who is the Only Sabbath that wee Chriſtians can, or ought to have.

And this error, of Sabbatarians mixed with their too hot, and ignorant zeal therein, and in ſome other Judaizing practiſes hath given our adverſaries occaſion to deteſt our Perſons, and alſo to blaſpheme our Religion, and (as a <hi>Luther an once did</hi> ſome <hi>Calviniſts,)</hi> to call us <hi>Baptized Jewes.</hi>

                  <p>All our learned Divines generally agree thus farr, that this Commandment is partly <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</hi> ſo that the Moral part thereof is to be obeyed, and kept, at this day, and alſo during the continuance of the world.

                  <p>But the main difficulty conſiſteth onely in the right dividing this Commandment, by ſeperating the <hi>Moral</hi> and everlaſting part, from that part which is but <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> and temporal, and typical.

                  </p>
                  <p>The want, or neglect of a right diſtinction of theſe differing parts of this Commandment in our later Theological Writers, hath occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned much trouble, heart-burnings, and Schiſms among Chriſtians, and alſo many Phrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall curioſities in the obſervation of an <hi>eighth day Sabbath.</hi> Which was never intended to be put upon the people of God by this 4th Commandement. And moreover, it hath alſo obſcured the moſt needfull, moſt holy, and <hi>Myſterious Sabbath</hi> Spirituall, by which we only can expect an eternall, and heavenly Sabbath, and ſalvation of our Souls and bodies.</p>
                  <p>For many good, pious and well-meaning Chriſtians are hereby miſlead into the ſame arror and miſtake, that the Jews were in, by thinking, that the whole and ultimate duty
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34379:43"/>
commanded, and intended in this 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, conſiſteth only, in keeping holy One day of Seaven; Which is but a very mean and low conceipt, and far ſhort of the High and Weighty intendment of that Precept, and is alſo a very <hi>ſtumbling Block</hi> in the way, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard men from apprehending the true Sabbath, therein ſecretly and <hi>myſteriouſly Veiled,</hi> Which is <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Who only, is the everlaſting Sabbath, or Reſt, both of the Godhead, and alſo of us Men.</p>
                  <p>It is now time, that I ſet down plainly what I conceive to be the Moral part of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and in what words it is contained, that ſo it may appear how much of that long Precept concerneth us at this day, and is an everlaſting Law, and a law Naturall, and Written in Mans heart, and binding not only Chriſtians, and Jews, but Heathens, and even all Nations; as alſo it did all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before <hi>Moſes</hi> was born, and before it was written in ſtone. Theſe are the words, <hi>Ex.</hi> 20. 8.</p>
                  <q>Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.]</q>
                  <p>In theſe few words, is contained the whole <hi>Morality</hi> of that Law: So that no more of the words are to be accounted <hi>Moral,</hi> or binding us: for all the following words are but a branch of the Ceremoniall law. And although they are here joyned with the truly Moral Sabbath, and alſo, by the ſame God, written in the ſame Tables of Stone; Notwithſtanding, this will not make them to be a Moral law, becauſe they are ſo annexed: for this reaſon only, to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34379:43"/>
ſerve as a <hi>Type</hi> and figure of the <hi>Grand Sabbath;</hi> To keep the Iſraelites mindfull by a weekly Sabbath, or <hi>reſt,</hi> of that everlaſting <hi>Reſt</hi> which they were to expect in their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and not otherwiſe. For now, we ſee that all learned Divines have rejected, and the whool Chriſtian world have long ſince diſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the old Jewiſh, Typical, or Seaventh-day Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>Theſe later words, which are ſo annexed to the fourth Morall Law, are to be conſidered by themſelves in their proper place: but for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we muſt inſiſt only on the former words which I have affirmed to be truly moral, and an everlaſting law.</p>
                  <p>For the underſtanding whereof, the Reader may obſerve divers things Conſiderable; and ſome of them proper, and peculiar to this Commandment, ſo as not to be found in any other of the Nine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In thoſe words recited, There is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Seaventh day</hi> (for that was meerly Typical, and Ceremonial) but the <hi>Sabbath-day:</hi> Therefore ſurely there muſt be underſtood ſome other <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> beſides the <hi>Seventh day Sabbath:</hi> for otherwiſe, it had bin enough to have ſaid <hi>Remember the Seaventh day to keep it holy:</hi> But the Seaventh day is one thing, and the Sabbath day is another.

2. To this Commandment, the Word <hi>[Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>member]</hi> is prefixed, as a <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> or fore runner of Chriſt; which <hi>Memento,</hi> we find not in any of the other <hi>Nine.</hi> Surely, there is ſomething in this Commandement, of moſt weighty concernment, and more than is in any other of the <hi>nine;</hi> for if in this Commandment God had only intended the keeping of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, (which we know was but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and to be left in its due time) he would not have ſaid, <hi>Remember;</hi> Becauſe all thoſe lawes, which are truly Moral, are alſo unexpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and undiſpenſable, and to be kept, (at leaſt,) to the end of the world; and this Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall law eſpecially, ſo long and longer alſo, even to Eternity: therefore, it deſerves a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this <hi>Memento,</hi> Some doe argue, that the Seaventh day Sabbath was obſerved before the dayes of <hi>Moſes;</hi> as if <hi>Remember,</hi> related only to former uſances. If that were true, it will make againſt their Seaventh day Sabbath, and for our truly Morall Sabbath, <hi>i. e. Chriſt;</hi> becauſe they may ſee that the Memento is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> but not to the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Day;</hi> for that was not alwaies to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In this <hi>Sabbatical Commandment,</hi> we finde, not only a <hi>Memento,</hi> going before; but alſo another <hi>remembrance</hi> following after it, as a type and ſhadow of the <hi>grand Sabbath</hi> for direction of God's people, as the <hi>Pillar of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34379:44"/>
and expectation of their <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> in whom only, true, certain, &amp; eternall Reſt was to be found. Indeed <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was to lead them into the <hi>Earthly Reſt</hi> of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the land of Promiſe; but he was but a type of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and is therefore called <hi>Jeſus, Acts</hi> 7. 45. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 8. and Canaan but a ſhadow of heaven; and the weekly Sabbath, but a figure of the Subſtantiall Sabbath; Only their Meſſiah, our Jeſus, was to lead his people into the bleſſed and everlaſting Sabbath or Reſt in heaven. Now the adding an annexion of a ceremonial type to this Sabbaticall and Moral law, which is not found in any other of the <hi>Nine,</hi> doth cleerly ſhew, that the <hi>Grand Sabbath</hi> here intended, is of the moſt weighty and Conſiderable concernment of all, and is therefore moſt principally to be <hi>Remembred.</hi> For if it were poſſible for us men preciſely to keep all the other <hi>Nine</hi> Commandments, ſuch a performance would not be Sufficient for our Eternall Reſt without the keeping of this. For this <hi>Sabbath is Chriſt,</hi> in whom alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideth all our hope, and confidence of heaven, &amp; <hi>there is none other name whereby we muſt be ſaved, Acts.</hi> 4. 12. And moreover, although we have tranſgreſſed, and broken all the other <hi>Nine,</hi> yet if we ſhall afterwards conſtantly and faithfully keep this Sabbath, we ſhall find therein an help and remedy, to preſerve us from the dangerous conſequences, that otherwiſe will follow us, upon ſuch diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

But now, all theſe Ceremonial Sabbaths are vaniſhed: This being granted, it will follow, in regard of the authority and perpetuity of the Moral Law of God, That there muſt needs be ſome one ſpecial, ſingular, and myſterious Sabbath of greater neceſſity and concernment to be ſtill kept, than all thoſe <hi>Hebdomarie,</hi> or <hi>Annual Sabbaths,</hi> and that ſurely is Chriſt, The Lord Paramount of all Sabbaths, which were but ſhadows of him. Whoſoever therefore ſhall imagine that the keeping of any weekly, or yearly Day Sabbath, is the principal, or only duty required in this Moral Law, he is ſuch an one as the Pſalmiſt deſcribeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 397. <hi>A man that walketh in a vain ſhadow]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is very conſiderable, and ſurely for ſome weighty reaſon, That our Saviour, very often in the Evangelical Hiſtories, occaſionally men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning theſe Moral Laws, and many of them diſtinctly and ſeverally, yet never ſpake in the leaſt expreſly and openly of the Sabbath Law, although that fourth Commandment (ſo far as it is Moral) is as neceſſary to be preſſed, and rather more, than any one, or indeed, then all the other (as is ſhewed before:) And yet it is not to be doubted, but that he meant, and alſo did covertly preſs this very Sabbath Law in the true intent and meaning thereof, to be for ever carefully obſerved and ſanctified. I do not take upon me to render a full account, of what moved Chriſt to forbear the reciting of that Law ſo openly, as he did other Moral Laws of the <hi>Decalogue;</hi> yet, it may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34379:51"/>
be thought that he on deſign and purpoſe omitted that Law, and indeed all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Laws of the <hi>firſt Table,</hi> becauſe he ſaw that the Jews did miſunderſtand that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Sabbath, and that they were zealouſly obdurate for keeping the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day Sabbath,</hi> as if that had been the full and only intendment and duty required by that Commandment: for, if Chriſt had urged it, the Jews had been by him countenanced in their erroneous Sabbatizing, which he came to diſſolve; therefore he forbare the naming of that particular Law, and for the ſame cauſe he abſtained from mentioning any of the other Laws of that Table; leſt if amongſt them this Law ſhould be omitted without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Jews would have been more exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated againſt him, before his time was come to ſuffer<hi>:</hi> This omiſſion of the Sabbath Law, the Reader may obſerve, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 17. Where Chriſt ſaid, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandements.]</hi> And when he was asked, <hi>Which Commandments?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Thou ſhalt not murther, nor commit adultery, nor ſteal, nor bear falſe witneſs:</hi> and, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy Father and Mother,</hi> and <hi>Love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf:]</hi> See the ſame again, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 19. and <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 20.

                  </p>
                  <p>But when he was more ſtrictly queſtioned by a knowing-man, a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> or <hi>Scribe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Profeſſor of the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 36. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which is the greateſt Commandment in the Law?]</hi> Yet then, he anſwered him but in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34379:51"/>
general terms, including the Laws of both Tables, without mentioning any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Law of either Table, thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c.</hi> This includeth all the four precepts of the firſt Table, Sabbath and all. He that performeth this, doth thereby keep the Sabbath. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to love, honour, and ſanctifie our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is our only Lord God, our God Incarnate, the <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> our Creator, Redeemer, and Saviour, is to keep this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sabbath: for he only is that Sabbath, which is myſteriouſly commanded to be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed in that Law; &amp; this Sabbath Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in full force and vigour at this day, and ſo ſhall to the end of this world, and for ever, when all other obſervations of ſeventh-Days, or any other worldly Sabbaths are quite forgotten and vaniſhed; for the true intended Sabbath is a <hi>Perſon,</hi> Chriſt, the Son of God, and the Son of man;</p>
                  <p>Finally, This Commandment, which I have ſet down in theſe words, <hi>[Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy]</hi> is certainly a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and an everlaſting Law: This Sabbath, if it be confeſſed to ſignifie Chriſt, we have what we deſire; but if it ſhould ſignifie only the keeping of a Day, whether the laſt day of the week (as the Jews think) or the firſt day (as ſome Chriſtians ſuppoſe;) then ſurely, the not keeping of one (at leaſt) of theſe two days, is a ſin, and muſt be ſo accounted, now under the Goſpel; for the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 34. <hi>Sin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law]</hi> He means, the <hi>Law Moral.</hi> But we are well aſſured, that the Goſpel doth not account the

Not-keeping of both, or either of thoſe days, to be a ſin againſt the fourth Commandment, or againſt any other of thoſe ten Moral Laws (except indirectly, and by conſequence): for in all the New Teſtament, we cannot find ſuch <hi>Sabbath-breaking</hi> to be ſo much as once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in any of the black Rolls of ſins, as other tranſgreſſions of all thoſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are particularly and often, by the great Apoſtle: See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9 <hi>Neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankinde nor Theeves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners ſhall inherit the kingdom of God.]</hi> See more, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, laſciviouſneſs, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

written in mans heart; and alſo that all thoſe <hi>Patriarks</hi> muſt be obliged to keep this <hi>Sabbath</hi> law, as well as any of the other <hi>Nine:</hi> This being granted; how ſhall we quit this learned Father from contradicting himſelf in theſe two propoſitions, <hi>firſt, The Patriarks were bound to keep the Sabbath; ſecond, The Patriarks neither did nor were bound to keep the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Riddle is eaſily unfolded, by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the Sabbath <hi>Moral</hi> from the Sabbath <hi>Ceremonial;</hi> that is, The true <hi>Real, Natural, and Subſtantial Sabbath</hi> from the <hi>Figurative, Typical, and Umbratical Sabbath;</hi> Or. the <hi>Body</hi> from the <hi>Shadow.</hi> We affirm therefore, that the Jewiſh, Hebdomarie, ſeaventh-day, or Saturday-Sabbath, was but the ſhadow or type; and that the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> even <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> our Lord <hi>Emmanuel</hi> was, and is, the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Sabbath, and the true Spirit and meaning of that Sabbatical law, and is the Lord of the Hebdomarie, or Typical Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
                  <p>We alſo affirm, that neither <hi>Adam,</hi> nor any of thoſe forenamed <hi>Patriarks</hi> did ever keep, or ſanctify any ſeaventh-day, or Saturday-Sabbath; and alſo that ſuch a Sabbath day was never known, or impoſed on Gods people, before the dayes of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And for this, we have the confeſſion of a learned Jew even <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> more than once. <note n="a" place="margin">

Before the time of Moſes, men were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Sabbath day]. This he affirmeth although with a Judaical excuſe, as if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer knowledg thereof had bin obliterated by Calamities.</p>
                  <p>But we alſo confeſs, and firmly believe that all thoſe holy <hi>Patriarks,</hi> were bound, and therefore did, certainly keep and ſanctify the true ſubſtantial Sabbath, before Moſes was born: for their Sabbath was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> even their true and onely Lord God, who in due time was to take our humane nature on him, So to be the <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> &amp; in our nature to perform the whole Law which the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head impoſeth on man, in our ſteed: and this, not only by an actual keeping and performing the Commandments, but alſo by a paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in ſuffring the puniſhment of our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; to quit his faithful ones from the ſentence of condemnation, and thereby to give comfort, eaſe, tranquillity, and ſo a <hi>Reſt</hi> or <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to our otherwiſe wearied, and trembling ſouls. For Chriſt only is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Seed of the woman which ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head:</hi> &amp; the birth, &amp; manifeſtation of him in the fleſh, is that day which <hi>our father Abraham rejoyced to ſee,</hi> and he is that <hi>well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, in whom alone the Godhead is well pleaſed,</hi> and reſteth ſatisfied, and at peace with us.

                  <p>That Chriſt only is the Sabbath Moral, to the ſanctification whereof, we all are perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged, was the Doctrin of the Ancient Church, as may appear by many expreſſions of

Church in the world;) This, we may diſcover by conſidering that prayer or ſuffrage, which this Church hath required to be by us ſaid at the rehearſing of this Sabbath-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as at each other of them, in theſe words.</p>
                  <q>Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.</q>
                  <p>This prayer, hath much troubled the minds of ſome of our Religious, and well-meaning Countrymen, becauſe their teachers did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right inform them in the true meaning of that Sabbath; for both in their pulpits, and alſo in their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>inted <hi>Catechiſms</hi> they expound it, to be meant only of ſanctifying a day as the Jews did. But if they ſo mean, this prayer would be not only vain, but alſo an impious mocking of God; ſeeing the Commandment mentions onely the <hi>ſeaventh day,</hi> and that preciſely, and none other, and that is our <hi>Saturday,</hi> which both we, and all other Chriſtian-Churches have utterly rejected; but if they thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our <hi>Sunday,</hi> that is not ſo much as mentioned, much leſs intended there; nor may it be called a <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, nor is the celebration of our Sunday to be enforced by vertue of that Commandment, but otherwiſe, as is before ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe Judicious, Leanred, and Godly men, and alſo heroical <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who were the compilers of our Engliſh <hi>Liturgy</hi> (as, <hi>Cranmer, Ridley and others,)</hi> did rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that Sabbath to ſignify Chriſt who onely is our Chriſtian Sabbath, and in this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34379:56"/>
ſence only we ought to underſtand it, and then this Prayer muſt needs be confeſſed to be pious, and neceſſary, and not otherwiſe; for the keeping of Chriſt, by faith in him, and ſanctifying him, that is, conſidering his worth, and benefits; and demeaning our ſelves towards him, ſo reverendly as becometh us, and belongeth to his ſuper-eminent holl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is the only way to procure an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranquillity, Reſt, and Sabbath to our Conſciences: For without this Sabbath all our care will prove vain, and the very God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head will be but a terrour to us. But if by God's merciful aſſiſtance, we keep our ſelves faſt in faith, and ſo in <hi>Union</hi> with this bleſſed Sabbath; we may then with comfort apply <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 42. 5.</note> that expoſtulation of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to our own ſouls; <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul? And why art thou diſquieted in me? Hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him for the help of his countenance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe the prayer above mentioned (though it were granted to us) is not full enough to ſupply, and ſatisfy our defects, and neceſſities: for neither a good inclination, readineſs, or willingneſs; nor yet our earneſt deſires no, nor our laborious endeavours to perform the Law, do amount to the real, and perfect keeping thereof, without which we cannot enter into life, as Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.

This prayer is grounded on the promiſe of God, recorded both in the Prophets, and alſo in the Goſpel: <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 18. 10. <hi>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.</hi> If we enquire what that Law is, and how God doth write it in our hearts and to what intent it is done: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, That this Law is Chriſt; The putting or writing of it in our hearts, is the <hi>miſſion of the Spirit of Jeſus into us.</hi> The intent or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thereof is; that by a <hi>ſpiritual union</hi> of Chriſt with us, we may fulfill the Law: For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt and his Members are united by this Spirit, and ſo become one myſtical body, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what Chriſt hath done in obedience to the Law, muſt be accounted as our obedience, and ſo imputed to us, that becauſe he hath perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Law, we alſo, in him, have performed it.

                     <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> If he can do all things, then he can do all the works of the Law: But we are well aſſured, that he could not in his own proper perſon alone conſidered, perform the Law, but it muſt needs be thus on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed by him, in and through Chriſt; And in this conſideration only, Chriſt is our Reſt and Sabbath.

Their reaſon is, becauſe, not only in this former part of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, which I have ſhewed to be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Natural, and an everlaſting Law; but alſo in the latter words annexed, which are a part of the Law ceremonial, and therefore but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and tranſient, it is alſo ſaid: <hi>The ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God,</hi> by which words, a man at firſt hearing would think that the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in both parts of this Law, is nothing elſe but <hi>a day:</hi> for, <hi>if the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day be a Sabbath, why may not the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath be thought to be a Seventh day?</hi>

                  <p>As the Godhead did really magnifie the Lord Jeſus, by uniting it ſelf in a Perſonal union with that man, and thereby made him the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Anointed One,</hi> (in which conſideration only, he is our Sabbath) and being ſo anointed, he was thereby really ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Godhead, and alſo (as that word ſignifies) he was ſeperated, diſtinguiſhed, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced, and preferred above all others, as it is ſaid of him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45. 7. <hi>God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows,</hi> that is, above all other <hi>Kings, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi> And <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>That God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name.</hi> So we ought to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> the ſame Lord Jeſus our Sabbath, in a way of preheminence, diſtinguiſhing him by

the reverence and honour which we perform to him, from all other perſons and honours; in a word, we muſt ſanctifie, honour, and worſhip him, farre more then any one, or then all the Creatures of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                  <p>God hath many <hi>holy Ones,</hi> but none ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as our Lord <hi>Jeſus;</hi> He is ſaid to be <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Father, John</hi> 10. 36. ſo are others; but Chriſt <hi>ſuper-eminently,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>God worketh all in all.</hi> So then, this Reſt cannot ſignifie Gods ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from working, nor the withdrawing his Providence from his Creatures.</p>
                  <p>But our <hi>Neoterick Theologs</hi> have found out another Anſwer, and do generally expound this Reſt of God, to ſignifie only a ceſſation from the work of Creation<hi>:</hi> for they ſay that, although God doth continually work, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, or co-operate with his Creatures which are already made, yet he doth not create or produce any new Creatures; indeed he dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh <hi>individual</hi> or <hi>particular</hi> Creatures, as Men, Beaſts, Fiſhes, Plants and Hearbs, hut all theſe new productions are of the ſame <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, i. e. ſort</hi> and kind, that God made at the firſt.</p>
                  <p>1. In this Anſwer we obſerve two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is confeſſed, that this <hi>Reſt</hi> of God is not an abſolute ceſſation from Work, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ceſſation from one particular Work, <hi>viz.</hi> from making any new ſpecies or kinds of Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is confeſſed, that this <hi>Reſt</hi> of God may conſiſt together with his working, for indeed the working or operation of God is as vigorous and ſtirring now, and ever ſince the Creation, as it was then; God did never intermit, or lay aſide his working.

                  <p>Beſides all this, Thoſe Writers that tell us, Gods <hi>Reſting</hi> ſignifieth only his finiſhing or ending the Creation; yet themſelves affirm, that God doth yet daily create <hi>new Souls;</hi> and this, becauſe they do not believe, that our Souls are propagated from our Progenitors, as our Bodies are; ſo that even by their own confeſſion, the Creation did not end on the firſt ſixth, or ſeventh day.

                  <p>To that which they ſay, That God doth not create any <hi>new kinds</hi> of Creatures, ſuch as in Schools are called <hi>Genera,</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi>

                  <p>Doubtleſs God did not beſtow the whole compaſs of each ſeveral day, with its evening and morning, in a continual creation, or form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſeveral Creatures; for each of them

                  <p>It is alſo very conſiderable, That although it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 11. <hi>In ſix dayes the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is:</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that all the Creatures were made, as the Angels of Heaven, the Fowls of the Air, and Man, Beaſts, Plants, Fiſhes of the Earth and Sea<hi>:</hi> Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is not yet ſaid to Reſt on this ſixth day. Surely this Reſt of God conſiſteth in ſomething elſe beſides theſe; it ſeems he reſted not in any, or all theſe <hi>meer Creatures,</hi> but in ſomething that was more noble and worthy of this great honour, of being the <hi>Acquieſcence</hi> or <hi>Reſt</hi> of the Godhead.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we ſay of the <hi>pre-exiſtence</hi> of God before the Creation, and the infiniteneſs and eternity thereof before all times, when nothing was in being, but only the pure God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in the three eternal Perſons? when neither Heaven, nor Earth, nor Man, nor Angels were created? We cannot ſay, or imagine, that God was then without Reſt; for beſides, that He
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34379:70"/>
with-held himſelf from creating, and from all external working, we know that he was at Reſt in himſelf, in his own bleſſed content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all-ſufficiencie, needing nothing: which Reſt of God could not then be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by any buſineſs, or outward operation. What the <hi>immanent</hi> or <hi>internal</hi> Actions of the Godhead were then, we know but little, and that only, which the holy Apoſtles have taught us, in whom we read of the eternal purpoſe of God to <hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If it be here ſaid, that although it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the 6th. day, yet it might be truly ſaid to be ended on the ſeventh day, becauſe it was ended before. As one in <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaid, <note n="b" place="margin">Plut. de Ira cohib.</note>

                     </gap>e further enquired, What particular work God made or finiſhed on the ſeventh-day, which was not ſo made on the ſixth day? In this we are Reſolved by many great and Learned Divines; That <hi>Adams</hi> ſide was not opened, until the morning of the ſeventh-day. And this may with great probability be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the narration of <hi>Moſes Gen.</hi> 2.

is ſaid, 1. <hi>God put the man into the garden of Eden. verſ.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>God gave him the Law againſt eating the forbidden fruit.</hi> 3. <hi>God ſaid, he would make him an help, meet for him.</hi> 4. <hi>God brought every Reaſt of the field, and every Foul of the aire unto Adam.</hi> 5. <hi>Adam gave names to all Cattel, and to the fouls of the aire, and to every Beaſt of the field v.</hi> 20. 6. <hi>God cauſed a deep ſleep to fall upon Adam.</hi> And then took one of his ribs, and of it made the woman.] All theſe tranſactions required a good ſpace of time, which reaſonably, might extend until the end of the <hi>ſixth day,</hi> and ſo unto the beginning of the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> which we know was to commence, and be accounted from the evening of the ſaid ſixth day. His travel Eſtward to Eden, and his naming that multitude of Creatures, might well cauſe wearineſs, and wearineſs might incline him to that <hi>deep ſleep,</hi> wherein the woman was made, and this may juſtly be judged to be within the compaſs of the <hi>ſeventh-day.</hi> For I think no man will deny, but that, between the Creation of the Man, and the extraction, and forming of the woman, a good portion of time inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened.</p>
                  <p>But then, (If <hi>Eve</hi> were not made or formed, before the ſeventh-day) how ſhall we ſalve the truth of the Scripture which ſaith, <hi>[In ſix dayes the Lord made heaven, and earth, the ſea, and all that in them is].</hi> To this the <hi>Anſwer</hi> is obvious, and frequent; for in the Creation of the man, the woman was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially, and materially included, <note n="a" place="margin">

So was Chriſt <hi>ſeminally</hi> in his <hi>Loines;</hi> ſo that the conſideration of Chriſt, now wrapped up in this Root of <hi>Adam,</hi> was that which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the firſt hint of an expreſſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencie in the Godhead upon the Creation of the Man; for thereupon, that was ſaid by God, which was not ſaid before upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any one, or of all his other Creatures, and it is ſaid with a note of Remarkableneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31. <hi>Behold! it was very good.</hi> Indeed his other Creatures are ſaid to be <hi>good,</hi> but not any, nor all, ſaid to be <hi>very good</hi> till now.</p>

                  <p>Now we may eaſily return an Anſwer to the above mentioned Enquiries, concerning the Reſt of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In which of the Creatures God is ſaid to Reſt?</hi> To this we ſay, That his Reſt was only in Mankind, not in the man alone, but (for the honour and everlaſting comfort of all holy Women) he expreſſed not his <hi>Reſt</hi> until he had formed the Woman out of the Man, although the manner thereof is declared, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of God's Reſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>What further uſe (beſides their Creat on) God intended to make of the Man and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</hi> To this we ſay, That God purpoſed out of the Man and Woman to raiſe and produce <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to be the Saviour and Redeemer of Mankind, from eternal and deſerved miſery; and alſo through the ſame <hi>Chriſt</hi> to crown Mankind with everlaſting glory; and for this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34379:75"/>
moſt gracious uſe only, did the Godhead de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it ſelf to <hi>Reſt;</hi> ſo that in Chriſt alone is the true, reall, and final Reſt, and Sabbath, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, both of God, and of us Men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>What prerogative or peculiar honour added God to this Creature Man, more then to any other Creature?</hi> To this we anſwer: 1. He made Man in his own Image, ſo, as not any other Creature was made. 2. From the Seed of Man, he ordained that the Redeemer ſhould proceed, and not from any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, although ſome others were more high &amp; excellent than Man, as <hi>the holy Angels are,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt made him a little lower than the Angels:</hi> Yet the Apoſtle tels <note place="margin">Pſal: 8: 5</note> us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. That <hi>Chriſt took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> 3. God purpoſed (which he alſo performed) to unite himſelf, ſo with Man, as not with any other Creature, to be <hi>one perſon</hi> with Man; even this very <hi>Creator,</hi> at this very time of Mans creation, intimated, that himſelf would one day become Man, that he would be <hi>incarnate,</hi> and ſo <hi>Emmanuel;</hi> which is obſcurely ſignified by thoſe words; <hi>In the Image of God created he him.</hi> And <note place="margin">Gen: 1. 27</note> this Incarnation was moſt needful for Man, becauſe in it only the everlaſting <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Reſt</hi> of Man conſiſteth, and in nothing elſe.</p>
                  <p>From theſe Premiſes, my Concluſion is, That the principal (and indeed the only) cauſe of this <hi>Reſt of God</hi> conſiſted in the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and gracious purpoſe of the Godhead to produce the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> out of the Man and the Woman, to be united with our humane nature,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34379:76"/>
and therein to fulfill the whole Will of God in our behalf, and ſo to become the Redeemer and Saviour of Mankind. Which concluſion, being a Doctrine of our greateſt concernment, we will in the next place endeavour, (by God's aſſiſtance) to make plain and evident, even to the capacity of ordinary underſtandings.</p>

                  <p>THat the Divine purpoſe of the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity was the ſole motive, that the <hi>Reſt of God</hi> was now (and not before) declared, may appear by many overtures, or expreſſions, in and about the Creation, and other affairs, concerning the firſt Man and Woman.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is ſaid by the Godhead; <hi>Let us make</hi>

                     <hi>Man.</hi> Whereby the concurrence of all the Divine Perſons in the Creation of Man is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; As if the Godhead would expreſs a ſpecial care, and deliberation, and alſo a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation about the Creation of Man, more than in the Creation of the whole inviſible World of Angels, or this viſible World of all the other Creatures; for it was never ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Let us make,</hi> but <hi>God created,</hi> and, <hi>Let there be Light;</hi> and, <hi>Let there be a Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth,</hi> &amp;c. Now, although we know that all the <hi>Three Divine Perſons</hi> did co-operate in the creation of every Creature; (as the ſure Rule of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines is), <hi>Opera Trinitatis ad extrà ſunt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſa:</hi> Yet their concurrence is not ſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red until the Creation of Man, Therefore, ſurely, a greater matter was intended, than the making of a meer Creature, and that certainly was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> even He that is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all Creatures, and of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip</hi>

                     <hi>him,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not only the making of Man is decreed, but it is added; <hi>In our Image and likeneſſe;</hi> and, <hi>In the Image of God created he him.</hi> Here is <hi>Our Image,</hi> Plurally; and, <hi>The Image of God,</hi> Singly. <hi>Our Image,</hi> ſignifies the Image of the <hi>Three Divine Perſons</hi> ſtamped on Man. <hi>Power, Wiſdom, Holineſſe;</hi> which are the Characters of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> (as Divines ſay). But this is not all, for, ſo much of this Image was ſoon deſaced: Nor was this Image proper to Mankind, but is found alſo in the holy Angels, and alſo more eminently in them than in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:34379:77"/>
But becauſe theſe words are ſaid of Man, &amp; not ſaid of any other Creature, therefore we muſt find out ſome other <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>likeneſſe of God,</hi> which is ſo peculiar to Man, as that it is not to be found in any other Creature, as <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is greatly to be conſidered, that the creation of the Woman was unlike the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Man; for <hi>Adam</hi> was made of Earth, immediately, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 19. but the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was not ſo made, but of the Man; ſhe was <hi>fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone,</hi> yea, and <hi>Soul</hi> of his <hi>Soul:</hi> for we find not, that God

                  <p>By this we may underſtand, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer was then intended (together with the whole race of Mankind) to be derived from that one root of <hi>Adam;</hi> for otherwiſe, Chriſt could not have been qualified ſo fitly, as to be our Redeemer.

                  <p>For, except Chriſt and Mankind be united in one humane nature, and ſo be as one Man, or as one Perſon, neither Chriſt's fulfilling the Law, nor his Death, can ſerve for us; becauſe the obedience of one cannot ſerve for another: nor doth the Juſt Godhead puniſh one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; but (as the Prophet tels us) <hi>Every</hi>

The man was indeed <hi>very good</hi> even in his own very creation, being but newly come out of the Creator's, hand; but yet, if man had ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſingly, and alone, without the woman, it had bin finally ill for him, by his own fault (the fall being foreſeen); for he muſt have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed thereby, being remedileſs.</p>
                  <p>Neither may we think that this Solitude of the man, was much bettered by the ſociety of the woman (conſidered meerly, &amp; ſingly of her ſelf) without any further intendment; the man had not yet need of her in reſpect of any corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or worldly neceſſity, for as yet, concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence was not entred into him; and moreover, he had ſociety, and converſation with God, and ſo might have had with holy Angels.</p>

                  <p>Finally, for this cauſe, it may reaſonably be thought, that the wiſdom and providence of the Godhead permitted the fall of man to be occaſioned by the woman, that ſo, the man might be induced, and neceſſitated, to ſeek for <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Help</hi> otherwiſe; and not in the <hi>Perſon,</hi> but in the bleſſed <hi>Seed</hi> and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the woman.

mentioned before in the 10th Chapter:</p>

                  <p>We may not think, that this expreſſion of the Reſt, Contentment, or Complacency of God, was occaſioned onely by the newneſſe of that work; as man pleaſeth himſelf in new apparell, new faſhions, or new buildings.

before, although it had been from everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>firſt</hi> of thoſe <hi>Queries,</hi> our Anſwer is, That the onely Reſt, or Sabbath of God, is <note place="margin">1 <hi>Querie</hi> anſwered.</note> the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> becauſe, in the <hi>Obedience</hi> of Chriſt, both <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive,</hi> the Godhead doth reſt ſatisfied, contented, and well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; not onely with the proper and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſon of Chriſt, but alſo (for, and in him) with all the holy Members of his Body my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, being by faith united, and One with him.</p>
                  <p>For therefore doth God reſt in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by him, the whole Law was to be (and now actually is) performed; ſo that all the duties, debts, and penalties, which, in juſtice, are requirable of his ſervants, are fully paid by Chriſt, and thereby the juſt Godhead is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied to the <hi>uttermoſt farthing.</hi> So that the Reſt of God is in no wiſe to be aſcribed to him, in reſpect of any ceſſation from the work of Creation, but onely in conſideration of the acquieſcence of God, in Chriſt's ſatisfaction, and thereby man's acquieſcence, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance from the wrath of God.</p>

or Perſonall union is made, whereby God and Man are become one Perſon, and ſhall ſo reſt inſeparably for ever.</p>
                  <p>To this we anſwer and affirm, that all the ſaid allegation is true, and that Chriſt may rightly be called the <hi>Reſt</hi> of God, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the everlaſting union of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with the human nature of Chriſt. But withall we ſay, that there is more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in this <hi>Reſt,</hi> than onely a meer union of God with man. For we muſt further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Why it pleaſed the Almighty Godhead to condeſcend to this abaſement, and <hi>Exina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi> ſo as to be perſonally united with a creature, and to be in the <hi>form of a ſervant,</hi> whereby the mighty God, in the perſon of the Son, became mortall, and ſubject to all the infirmities of mankind, (except ſin) and even death alſo.</p>
                  <p>By the ſerious meditation hereof, we ſhall find, that the finall cauſe, or motive of this union of the Godhead with our human nature, was not intended, or effected, for any reſt, contentment, or complacency of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head for it ſelf, becauſe God, in reſpect onely of himſelf, did not ſtand in need of any ſuch Reſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It being thus evident, that this Reſt of God is not called a Reſt in reſpect of himſelf, but only in reſpect of that Reſt, which by his goodneſſe and mercy he hath ordained for his poor Creatures. It muſt needs follow, that God calleth that his Reſt, which is indeed (not only principally, but) ſolely, the Reſt of Mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For our Lord Jeſus, the <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> is therefore the Reſt or Sabbath of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, becauſe he is the Reſt or Sabbath of us Men, in whom and through whom only, our (otherwiſe languiſhing and fainting) ſouls may find conſolation, reſt, and refreſhment; he is the only ſolid hope, and Sabbath, upon whom we can depend, and reſt, and expect, and hope for an eternall Reſt, for in and by him only, the offended Godhead is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable, ſo as to be at peace and Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Man, and to reſt ſatisfied, or well pleaſed, as the Angels ſang at his Nativity, <hi>Glory be to God—and on Earth peace, Good will towards Men;</hi> Or, (as <hi>Beza</hi> more truly reads it) <hi>To Men</hi>

                  <p>From theſe premiſes I infer the 4 concluſions following, which I offer to the conſideration of the Chriſtian Reader: and do here ſet them down, that in this Doctrine of the Sabbath I may be rightly and plainly underſtood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:34379:91"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Chriſt is that only Sabbath, or Reſt, both of God and Man, which is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and meant in the <hi>fourth Commandement;</hi> and alſo in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Chriſt is therefore called the Reſt of God, becauſe God hath in mercy ordained him to be the Reſt for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That God cannot otherwiſe be ſaid to Reſt in Chriſt (for our good) but only becauſe all faithful and holy Men do ſet up their Reſt in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Reſt of God (here meant) conſiſteth only in the Reſt of Man; and that God calleth that his Reſt, which indeed is primarily and properly Mans Reſt.</p>
                  <p>The Reſt of God cannot be meant of any new reſt, in reſpect of himſelf only, becauſe it is impoſſible that any increaſe or acceſs can be added to infiniteneſs, ſuch as is the bleſſed, eternal, and unſpeakable Reſt of the Godhead: Therefore there muſt needs be ſome other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal reſpect, in which God is ſaid to reſt otherwiſe, than before, and that ſurely is the Reſt which he hath procured for Man, which God calleth his own Reſt.</p>
                  <p>The holy Scriptures do very often aſcribe the paſſions or affections of Men unto God; as when God is ſaid to <hi>repent,</hi> to be <hi>angry,</hi> to be <hi>greived,</hi> and <hi>vexed,</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſed;</hi> although we are ſure that no ſuch changes can conſiſt with the immutable Godhead; for the ſame Scripture that ſaith, in one place, <hi>It repented</hi>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34379:91"/>
ſuch ſpeeches are but <hi>Anthropo-pathetical,</hi> or <hi>after the manner of Men;</hi> as a Man puls down an houſe which himſelf built, becauſe he is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry or diſpleaſed with it; ſo God in juſtice deſtroyes ſome Creatures which himſelf made: yet God is not angry, but becauſe he doth ſuch a thing as Man in Anger doth, therefore he is ſaid to be angry. Juſt ſo, the Reſt which is only in Man, is here for the like reaſon called Gods Reſt. As when a provident Father hath ſettled a good and firm eſtate upon his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he will ſay, that now he is at reſt and quiet, although he neither intermit his work, nor perſonally enjoy that eſtate, yet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his Childrens good his own; even as God doth here call the reſt of his Creatures his own Reſt.

Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. For if the ſeventh day were the onely Sabbath intended in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, we Chriſtians ſhould at this day be bound to keep it, as much as the Jews were.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt, or the Apoſtles, changed the ſeventh day to the eighth, or <hi>Saturday</hi> to <hi>Sunday,</hi> is often too boldly affirmed by our Sabbatarian Writers, and too tamely ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by their followers; which, as yet, they never have, or ever can ſolidly prove.</p>
                  <p>But to ſay that Chriſt utterly diſſolved the Ceremoniall, or ſeventh-day Sabbath, and yet left the true Sabbath unaltered to us, (which is our firm Reſt in himſelf); and that the Church firſt, then Chriſtian Magiſtrates alſo, aſſumed another day, even our <hi>Sunday,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Jewiſh ſeventh day, for their holy Aſſemblies, is true, and eaſily proved; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they never called this <hi>Sunday</hi> a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. Nor can the Jewiſh ſeventh day poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be that Morall Sabbath which is meant, and intended in this fourth Commandment, becauſe it is here ſaid, <hi>The ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For we are well aſſured, that the ſeventh day is not ſo to be accounted the Reſt of God, as if God ceaſed from his operation on every, or, on any one ſeventh day; but his Reſt was onely in conſideration of the Saviour of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, becauſe on the firſt ſeventh day of the world, he formed the Woman, (as is before ſhewed) and even then, on that ſeventh day, and ever ſince upon every ſeventh day, he hath been operative in governing the world, and co-operating with every creature therein, without any intermiſſion at all. But he is ſaid
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34379:101"/>
to reſt on that ſeventh day, becauſe then our firſt parents were compleatly and fully fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and in them was laid the foundation of the future Church, (that is) Chriſt; who, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his holy Members, was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated joyntly from the Man and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. So that Chriſt onely was, and is, the Sabbath, or Reſt, of God and men.</p>
                  <p>Upon this reaſon it was, that the ſeventh day was long after ſanctified, or ſet apart, for a day of bodily reſt, that thereby it might be a type, figure, and ceremoniall remembrance, or commemoration of Chriſt, the great and myſterious Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Seventh day, and the Sabbath day, are two diſtinct and ſeverall things, and differ as much as the ſhadow and the body, or as Chriſt and the Lamb, that is, as much as Type and Anti-type: For, as the Lamb lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally was not Chriſt, but his figure; ſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, literally conſidered, was not the Sabbath here meant; but, typically, the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or repreſentation thereof. Juſt ſo the Apoſtle ſaith of this ſeventh-day-Sabbath, and of other ſuch like ceremonies, that <hi>they are a ſhadow of things to come, but the body is</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reader may further obſerve, that it is not here ſaid, <hi>The ſeventh day was the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,]</hi> but <hi>Is,</hi> in the preſent tenſe; and this, becauſe God never declared, that the ſeventh day ſhould be obſerved, untill the daies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> although the Godhead did ever, from the firſt ſeventh day, acquieſce in Chriſt<hi>:</hi> and not onely upon the ſeventh day, but every day, and every minute, and ſo will do to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34379:101"/>
eternity, when no diſtinction of daies ſhall be any more, but one everlaſting day. Therefore they are miſtaken, that think the ſeventh day to have been appointed to be obſerved, on the firſt ſeventh day of the world, as a Sabbath; for in all the Hiſtories of the Patriarks, before the Flood, and alſo after the Flood, in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall Hiſtory of <hi>Noah, Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Reader will never find the word, <hi>Sabbath,</hi> ſo much as once mentioned, untill <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the Hiſtory of his own time, which was about 24 hundred years after the creation of the world.</p>
                  <p>We obſerve alſo, that in St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Originall) and generally in all the Latin Writers, <hi>Calvin</hi> and all, theſe words are otherwiſe read than our Engliſh Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath rendred them; for we read them thus, <hi>The ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God;]</hi> but they, <hi>Septimo die, Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Domini Dei tui eſt.]</hi> i. e. <hi>On the ſeventh day the Sabboth of the Lord thy God is.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe words it may appear, that the ſeventh day was not the true and reall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath here meant, but that the celebration and memoriall of the Morall Sabbath was to be performed on the ſeventh day: ſo that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath and the ſeventh day are two diſtinct things, and differ as much as ſubſtance and ſhadow. For, the Reſt of God in Chriſt, is the true Sabbath both of God and men; and the corporall reſt of men was no more, but onely the memoriall and celebration thereof.</p>

So it is here, the ſeventh day was not the true, reall, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sabbath, but onely the day appointed for the memoriall and celebration of that Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. for the true Sabbath was the reſt of God and men in Chriſt; and the ſeventh day was the time appointed for the celebration thereof. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith of Chriſtian Feſtivalls, <note n="e" place="margin">

2. If this branch did belong to the Morall Sabbath, or, if the ſanctifying of the ſeventh day were the onely Sabbath, meant in this Commandment, ſurely it would be a great ſin to do any of the prohibited works on that day, in any caſe of neceſſity or inconvenience; becauſe the Morall Law of God is indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, and ſo may not be tranſgreſſed upon any pretence whatſoever, as is before ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>3. If this branch were Morall, it muſt needs be in force at this day, and then, No fire muſt be kindled, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 3. No ſticks gathered, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 32.

                  <p>But if we can ſhew, that ſuch works were done on the ſeventh day; and alſo, that they are ſufficiently warranted to be inoffenſive to God, then, I truſt, the Reader will perceive, that this prohibition of works doth not at all belong to the keeping of the true, morall, and everlaſting Sabbath, but onely to the Jewiſh ſanctifying of their ceremoniall and temporall Sabbath.

people of God keep and ſanctifie the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall Sabbath, though with the breach, or (as Chriſt ſaid) <hi>profanation</hi> of the ſeventh day, or ceremoniall Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>If it be here demanded, why God ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required a ceſſation from work, and a corporeall Reſt on the ſeventh day, ſeeing he did not expect ſo exact an obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? To this we anſwer; That, as the ſeventh day was but the type of the true Sabbath, which is Chriſt; ſo the corporall reſt therein, was but the figure or ſigne of our ſpirituall and eternall reſt in Him. Therefore, as the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall, or ſeventh-day Sabbath, in ſome caſes, might be tranſgreſſed, yet without any breach or neglect of the true Sabbath, (which is Chriſt) ſo our corporall reſt might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed many waies in this life, by labours, ſorrows, ſufferings, and perſecutions, yet without any diſturbance of our ſpirituall reſt, comfort, ſettlement, joy, and peace, in <hi>the God of all conſolation;</hi> for ſo Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Theſe things have I ſaid unto you, that in me ye might have peace, in the world ye ſhall</hi>

                  <p>This is added, becauſe otherwiſe the Jews might have thought it no tranſgreſſion in themſelves, to have cauſed their children or ſervants to work, if the parents or maſters wrought not.

                     <hi>Brerewood</hi> hath obſerved) which to affirm is moſt ridiculous. But if the Jewiſh ſons, or ſervants, or ſubjects, had wrought on their Sabbath at their own choice, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or compulſion of their Rulers; then the tranſgreſſion, or Sabbath-breach, muſt have been their own, and the puniſhment thereof inflicted on themſelves onely, and not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <q>Thy man-ſervant, nor thy maid-ſervant.</q>
                  <p>The condition of ſervants was lamentable, their maſters power over them was great, and ſo was their cruelty. God therefore provided ſome eaſe for them; otherwiſe, the unmercifull and covetous Jews would have afforded no reſt to them at all. Neither did the Judaicall Laws of the Jews, wholly provide againſt the cruelty of maſters; for if a Jew, by cruell <note place="margin">Ex. 21. 20.</note> ſtripes, had killed his ſervant, the maſter was not puniſhable by the Law Judaicall, if the abuſed ſervant continued alive a day or two after; nor, except he died under his hand: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (no doubt) the maſter ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the morall Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kiil,]</hi> and was therefore anſwerable to God for murder.</p>
                  <p>But their condition under the Gentiles was far worſe, who had legall power of life and death over them. They were not onely bought and ſold like cattle, but alſo eſteemed as vile, or worſe than their beaſts. One makes it a queſtion, <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Jewiſh-Sabbath was a type or figure of Reſt, not onely of mankind after the end of this world, but alſo of the reſt and freedom, of other worldly and domeſtick creatures, which are now ſubſervient to man, and toiled with labours; as the Ox, and Aſſe, the Horſe, and Mule, and Camell, &amp;c. A mercifull man cannot chuſe, but many times to pitty and commiſerate the exceſſive la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and daily ſlaughterings of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; of which, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, that one day, <hi>They ſhall be delivered from the bondage—under</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 21</note> 
                     <hi>which the whole creation groaneth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the working of domeſtick cattle, muſt needs require the aſſiſtance and co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man. Therefore it is here forbidden.</p>
                  <q>Nor the ſtranger that is within thy gates.</q>
                  <p>By this Law, other Nations are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from working on the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which did not at all concern them<hi>:</hi> Onely if aliens, or forrainers, did ſojourn within the Jewiſh-gates, that is, within the juriſdiction, either Domeſtick, or Politick, of the Jews; then the Jews are required to cauſe them to forbear working on their Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day. So that this reſtraint of aliens or ſtrangers, was confined to be onely within the Jewiſh limits and territories; for, ſtrangers or
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34379:107"/>
aliens abiding in other places, out of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh pale were at liberty to work and for ſo doing, the Jews are not, by this Law, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to forbid or hinder them.</p>
                  <p>That ſons, ſervants, and even cattel, are here placed before ſtrangers, the reaſon is, 1, Becauſe they are the Jews own peculiars, of nearer relation, and more ſubject to their commands, than ſtrangers are. 2. To intimate, that the Jews ſhould firſt practiſe and obey the Law in their own perſons, and families; for otherwiſe it would ſeem vanity, pride, or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, to require obedience or compliance from others. There is a woe to ſuch as <hi>lade other men with burdens, which themſelves will</hi>

                  <q>Certain Obſervations, ariſing from this Expoſition.</q>
                  <p>By what hath been ſaid, it may evidently appear to a diligent Reader, that this ſeventh-day Sabbath was meerly Ceremoniall, and concerned onely the Jews, or Iſraeliticall peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not other Nations, as may be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the premiſes, for theſe reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the tranſgreſſion or violation of this Sabbath-Law, by ſons or ſervants, by command or compulſion of their Rulers, is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34379:107"/>
here declared to be the ſin of the commander onely, and not of the ſon or ſervant; which could not be, if this Law were Morall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If this ſeventh-day Sabbath-keeping were a Law Morall; then it muſt follow, that whoſoever tranſgreſſed therein, whether by his own will and election, or by command, or fear, or compulſion, greatly ſinned. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the Chriſtian Martyrs might have been as well excuſed, if they had worſhipped the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then-Idolls, when they were commanded by their lawfull Princes, and, moreover, terrified by exceſſive torments and death. But they knew, that Idolatry was forbidden by a Law Morall, and therefore refuſed to obey. But this ſeventh-day Sabbatizing is not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Morall, but onely by a Law Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe words, <hi>[Thou, and thy ſon, and thy daughter, thy man-ſervant, &amp;c.]</hi> are not ſaid of any other of theſe morall Laws; Not, of having <hi>other gods,</hi> nor of <hi>Idols,</hi> nor <hi>Perjury,</hi> nor <hi>diſhonouring Parents,</hi> nor <hi>Murder,</hi> nor <hi>Aduliery,</hi> nor <hi>Theft,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe ſons, daughters, and ſervants, tranſgreſſing any of theſe truly Morall Laws, though by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or terrour of their Governours, yet the ſin muſt be their own. But if ſons or ſervants did work on this Ceremoniall Sabbath, by command and compulſion, the ſin was in the commander, and not in the obeyer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this muſt needs be a Ceremoniall Precept, and not Morall; and it is impoſed on Parents, Maſters, and Governours, becauſe the fault is not in the ſervants obedience to his Maſter, but in the Maſters diſobedience to God.

Thus this Writer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſheweth, that the Jewiſh Seventh-day Sabbath was none of the Moral Lawes of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Finally, Let it be conſidered, that theſe words, <hi>[Thou, thy Son, Servant, Cattel, and Stranger]</hi> are not placed at the beginning of this fourth Commandement, as <hi>(Remember)</hi> is; nor mentioned until the Moral part of this Law was deſcribed, and finiſhed: But they are with great wiſdome warily reſerved, to be put into the Ceremonial part thereof; becauſe they do not belong to the Moral Sabbath, which commandeth the keeping holy, or the ſanctifying of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> for Cattel can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſanctifie this Moral Sabbath. Nor was there any need of requiring Parents, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to cauſe their Sons or Servants ſo to do, becauſe the Son and Servant were by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to it; and if they did not, the ſin was in themſelves, and not in the Parent or Maſter. For the Moral Sabbath (which is Chriſt the <hi>Meſſiah)</hi> might be kept holy, or ſanctified, by Servants, even in the midſt of their ſoreſt labours. As our Chriſtian Martyrs did keep this Sabbath, even in the time when they laboured in the Mettal-mines, and alſo, in the

Whereas the Ceremonial, or Seventh-day-Sabbath, is here appointed to be kept by reſting from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary works, without any mention of any other kind of ſanctification; which not only Servants, and the moſt ignorant Ideots, but Cattel alſo, might keep: For ſo the Heathen <hi>Romans</hi> had a Feſtival, which they called, <note n="a" place="margin">

                     </gap> to command only, and not to perſwade. It ſeemed otherwiſe to our Merciful Law-giver, who to his Laws hath added both a <hi>Prologue,</hi> and an <hi>Epilogue</hi> alſo; by which he not only commandeth, but diſputeth his <hi>Leiges</hi> into obedience, as being moſt expedient and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to themſelves: for it ſhould ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Man to obedience of that Law, which is impoſed on him by the mighty <hi>Creator of Heaven and Earth.</hi>

                  <p>But the motive uſed in this fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of ſanctifying the Sabbath, is far ſtronger; becauſe the deliverance of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of bondage, might poſſibly have been performed, either by Treaty, or by the Arme of fleſh, without thoſe plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and wonders at the Red Sea; for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were numerous enough to have fought the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and to ſubdue them; they wanted

only Arms and Utenſils of Warr, which yet might reaſonably have either been forced from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or ſupplied by a forrain power; we well know, <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This great motive here uſed, to incline us to ſanctifie the Sabbath, doth evidently ſhew, that this Sabbath-Law is of greater concernment to us, than the firſt Law is. The reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have declared before <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 5.</note>. And moreover, That the Sabbath which is here principally meant, doth not conſiſt in keeping of a day, whether the laſt day of the week (which God impoſed upon the people of Iſrael only, and that but for a certain time): Or the firſt day of the week (which God never at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded): But another kind of Sabbath is here commanded to be ſanctified; which Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath being rightly and deeply conſidered, will prove and appear to be that very ſame <hi>Lord God</hi> that made Heaven and Earth.</p>
                  <p>For we have proved before: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> mentioned in the Moral part of this Commandement, doth ſignifie <hi>God the Son,</hi> becauſe in him only the Godhead can be truly ſaid to Reſt, and not otherwiſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have proved, That the Jewiſh Seventh day Sabbath was appointed only, to be for a type, figure, and memorial, or commemoration of that true and grand Sabbath (which is Chriſt). From theſe premiſes we here inferre, That the <hi>making of Heaven and Earth</hi> is mentioned in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34379:116"/>
this Commandment on purpoſe, for a motive to incite us to a ſerious, and moſt reverentiall ſanctification of this true, reall, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he that is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> is the great <hi>Day-ſpring from on high;</hi> and is really, <hi>He that made heaven and earth.</hi> So that if we will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the Creator of heaven and earth is to be worſhipped and ſanctified by us, then muſt we alſo confeſſe, that this Sabbath which is the Son of God, is ſo to be ſanctified.</p>
                  <p>No learned or prudent Chriſtian (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) will deny, that this <hi>Son of God</hi> was the Creator of Heaven and Earth; or, if any do, the Scriptures and primitive Church will gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay them.</p>

The bleſſing of a Day, is not like his bleſſing of a Man; on whom, by bleſſing, he doth effectually conferre ſomething that is beneficial to him, as ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Graces, or temporal Favours, as <hi>in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Lands, Cattel, Basket and Store,</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. and as <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſed his Sons, with <hi>the dew of Heaven, and fatneſſe of the Earth.</hi> But the Sabbath being uncapable of ſuch benedictions, the bleſſing of it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſuch reſpects as theſe. 1. God choſe that day for his own <hi>Myſterious Reſt.</hi> 2. He appointed that day only, and not any of the other <hi>ſix,</hi> to be for a memorial to his people of the grand bleſſing of their Reſt in Chriſt. 3. He ordained it for a corporal reſt, both for Men and Cattel. 4. He gave moſt ſtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, upon pain of capital puniſhment, for the keeping thereof. 5. He appointed lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Sacrifices on that day, than on the former dayes. 6. He appointed a larger portion of Manna on the <hi>Paraſceue,</hi> as a proviſion for the Sabbath. 7. He appointed this holy day to be weekly, that is, two and fifty times in the year, whereas other Feſtivals (except new-Moons)
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34379:123"/>
were but once. Theſe, or ſuch like, are the bleſſings thereof.</p>
                  <q>And hallowed it.</q>
                  <p>Hallowed is holied, or ſanctified; The meaning is, that God deſigned it to be an holy or hallowed day.</p>
                  <p>To be an hallowed, or ſanctified day, is, to be divided, ſeparated, or diſtinguiſhed from other common dayes, by way of preferment, honour, and preheminence, and to be ſet apart ſo, as, that work which might lawfully have been done on that day, before it was hallowed, might not be done on it, after the hallowing thereof.</p>
                  <p>We read of <hi>hallowed,</hi> or <hi>holy oyl, holy veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, holy veſtments,</hi> and <hi>holy places,</hi> which might not be uſed or applied to any other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but that only, for which they were hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and deſtinated; So this hallowed day, was not to be imployed in common works, as other unhallowed dayes were (for that would have been a profanation thereof;) but it was wholly to be beſtowed and ſpent in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God the Sanctifier, by the ſerious and thankful conſideration of that bleſſed Reſt, which he had procured and deſigned for Man; And this hallowed uſe was to continue from the firſt inſtitution thereof, untill the period, and repealing of it, by the ſame God, who hallowed it. Which was performed evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Jeſus Chriſt, who is the ſame God, which did ſanctifie it; and this he did not, untill God had actually, and viſibly, exhibited in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But yet (during the vigour and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this <hi>hallowing)</hi> the Sabbath day was not altogether and abſolutely quitted from all manner of working; We know the Prieſts did then work hard, and Souldiers marched, and other works were lawfully done; the reaſon was, becauſe this Sabbatical <hi>Hallowing</hi> was but meerly figurative and ceremonial, and therefore diſpenſable in caſe of preſſing neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and charitable accommodation toward our brethren, and in duty to God; and alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch workings are commanded by a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Law, even the Moral Law of God, whereby we are required, <hi>To love the Lord our God with all our heart, and our neighbour as our ſelf.</hi> This Law hath been in force ever ſince the Creation was finiſhed, and ſo ſhall continue until the end of the World; but the <hi>hallowing</hi> of the Seventh day, was neither from the beginning, nor was it to laſt to the end of the World, being but Ceremonial and Temporary; and therefore ought to give place to the Law Moral.</p>

                  <p>But then, the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> having been thus <hi>hallowed,</hi> or ſanctified by God, How comes it to be <hi>unhallowed,</hi> and laid common with other dayes?

                  </p>
                  <p>To this our Anſwer is. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Man might not preſume to alter or null any of Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, without <hi>Divine warrant:</hi> But the diſſolution of this Sabbath-day was done by the grand Warrant of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and by him then, when he was <hi>the Great Son of Man. Secondly,</hi> We ſay, That God never unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, or revoked any Sanctions which Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ordained, during the time, and purpoſes that were by him intended for them to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in force and uſe. For ſome Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions were inacted to continue but for a ſet-time, as the <hi>Types</hi> were, <hi>Sacrifices, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, Paſſover, Tabernacle,</hi> and this <hi>Sabbath;</hi> all which, and many ſuch, were but Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Sanctions: But others were ordained by him to continue to the end of the World; as all the <hi>ten Commandements,</hi> which are <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Moral:</hi> Theſe God never yet revoked, nor never will: But the other ſort, which
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34379:125"/>
were but Ceremonials, and intended to laſt but during the Pedagogie of his People, and ſo for a certain limited time, <hi>viz.</hi> untill the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Son of God in the fleſh.</hi> Which being accompliſhed, thoſe temporary Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were to ceaſe; and this, without any Mutability on Gods part, or Sacrilege of Men. Juſt, as when a Man gives a penſion, or rent, to a pious uſe, for a limited time of ten, twenty, or thirty yeares, and no longer; when that time is expired, the Penſion may ceaſe, without any Sacrilege of the Doner.</p>
                  <q>Hallowed.</q>
                  <p>The principal Queſtion in this <hi>hallowing,</hi> which hath moſt perplexed the minds of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Chriſtians, is, concerning the <hi>Time,</hi> when God did actually hallow, or ſet apart the Seventh day, whether on the firſt Seventh day of the World, or, whether not before the dayes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>To this we anſwer confidently and reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; That although it is moſt certain, that God did reſt on the firſt Seventh day of the World, (but ſo, as hath been at large ſhewed before), yet he never appointed or hallowed a weekly Seventh day for Man's reſt, untill the dayes of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Our Reaſons for this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> If the weekly Seventh day had been hallowed at the beginning, as a Law, it muſt have been, either written in Mans heart, as all Moral Lawes of God were ever ſince Man was made; or elſe it muſt have been openly declared
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34379:126"/>
as a <hi>Law poſitive.</hi> But the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was not written in Man's heart; For if ſo, then it muſt have bound all Nations in all Ages, which as yet it never did. Neither was i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> then declared overtly as a <hi>Law poſitive;</hi> for if ſo, then certainly we ſhould have found ſome mention, or footſteps of it in the Hiſtory of the Patriarks, which lived before <hi>Moſes:</hi> But we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ind nothing of it in all that long time; and we are well aſſured, that neither <hi>Adam,</hi> nor any of his poſterity, did ever ſo Sabbatize untill the dayes of <hi>Moſes.</hi> This is the Doctrine of the Fathers generally, and of the Church Primitive.</p>

Here I deſire the learned Reader to conſider with me, why it pleaſed the Divine Wiſdom to put ſo late and low a date to the whole <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> of the Law Moral, which we are well aſſured was in force from the creation of the firſt Man?

to be made the Sabbath for Man, yet not as he is meerly <hi>the Son of God,</hi> but as he is alſo, <hi>the Son of Man.</hi> He was made Man for us, and by that he became the Myſtical Sabbath. For the Son of God conſidered in his pure Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, cannot be the Sabbath; neither can the Son of Man be ſo, if conſidered without his Divinity, but joyntly with both Natures: So that in conſideration of his aſſumed humane Nature, and therewith his Sabbathſhip, he was made for Man, and came to help, and miniſter to Man, as himſelf moſt graciouſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; <hi>The Son of Man came not to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred</hi>

By this it may clearly appear, that the ſeventh-day Sabbath was only a national Conſtitution, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſtanding of the Judaical Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and that the Seventh day was not that Moral Sabbath which God required in this fourth Commandement; becauſe a Law Moral bindeth all Nations in every part of the Earth: but ſome other Sabbath was intended, which poſſibly might be kept by all Nations; &amp; that Sabbath is Chriſt.

A Jew, in a boyſterous Sea, refuſed to tug at the ſtern, becauſe it was his Sabbath day, and ſo he periſhed. Another would not be drawn out of a loathſome draught upon the ſame reaſon, but rather miſerably periſhed, as our own Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories record.</p>
                  <p>The Jews could not be ignorant, that God himſelf did work on every Sabbath-day, and that he did alſo occaſionally command others ſo to do, as the Preiſts, and ſometimes the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; therefore they might eaſily have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that both the Sabbath, or Reſt of God, and alſo of his people, conſiſted in ſomething elſe, and not in a meer ceſſation from worldly works. Some Sabbatarian Writers tell us, <hi>That Man ſhould work when God worketh, and reſt when God reſted.</hi> But God worketh alwayes, ſo cannot Man<hi>:</hi> If they had ſaid, that Man ſhould reſt in that thing, which God reſted in,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:34379:137"/>
they had ſpoken home to the true Sabbath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: For God reſted only in Chriſt, and ſo ſhould we; otherwiſe all Seventh-day Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing is utterly vain and ſuperſtitious.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Reaſons a pious and judicious Reader will clearly perceive, that theſe ſlurrs were put upon the <hi>Day Sabbath</hi> by our Wiſe God, on purpoſe, and deſign, to withdraw his people from the ſhadow to the ſubſtance, and from the Ceremonial to the Moral, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Sabbath, which is Chriſt<hi>:</hi> for juſt ſuch a deſign God had in his Diſpenſation, even of the Moral Law, which was firſt written in Man's heart: Then afterwards, when it was to our lapſed and depraved nature impoſſible, yet it was again impoſed on us, and engraven in ſtone: And this he did, that thereby he might direct us, both to perform ſo much of it as we can, and alſo to ſeek help and mercy of him, for what we cannot do.</p>
                  <p>There had been no need of writing this Law in Tables of ſtone, which was written defore in Man's heart, but only, becauſe, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <note n="a" place="margin">
